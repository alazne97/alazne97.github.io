  <p>Nowadays there are many groups that sing in vasc, but one of the most succesful groups in The Basque Country is Berri Txarrak, that means "Bad News". It was founded in 1994
in Navarre and they play alternative rock. Despite singing in vasc they make international routes and people all over the worl love their music. They have been playing in the same stage with
Rise Against and they have a song together. One of the most interesting facts about this group is that in june of 2017 they performed for one person in Paris because he was the
 only one that was there. However, they gave everything they have...This is what it means to have respect for the public. </p>
